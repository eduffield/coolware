//Ensure that you have proper AWS credentials configured before running the code. You can configure credentials using one of the following methods:

//AWS CLI: Use aws configure command to set up AWS CLI with your access key and secret key.
//Environment Variables: Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
//IAM Roles: Use IAM roles if running your code on AWS services like EC2, Lambda, or ECS.
//Always remember to handle your AWS credentials securely and follow AWS security best practices to ensure the security of your applications and data.
